    README file for the `itcp' GAP4 package

This Package provides a routines to construct explicit polyhedral
converses via polyhedral projection. It dependends on GAP packages
symchm (for symmetry exploiting polyhedral projection) and
qsopt_ex-interface (for exact rational LPs). These packages and their
installation instructions can be found at:
    https://github.com/jayant91089/symchm
    https://github.com/jayant91089/qsopt_ex-interface

To get the newest version of this GAP 4 package download archive file
    itcp-x.zip
and unpack it using
    unzip itcp-x.zip

Do this preferably (but not necessarily) inside the `pkg' subdirectory
of your GAP 4 installation. It creates a subdirectory called `itcp'.

This completes the installation of the package.


E-mail me if there are any questions, remarks, suggestions. Also, we
would like to hear about applications of this package.
