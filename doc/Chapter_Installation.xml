ITCP requires GAP package symchm <Cite Key="jayantsymchm"/> for symmetry exploiting polyhedral projection, along with
package <Math>\texttt{qsopt}\_\texttt{ex-interface}</Math> for solving linear programs exactly using rational arithmetic.
You can find information about how to install them in their respective user manuals.
To get the newest version of ITCP, download the .zip archive from <URL>https://github.com/jayant91089/itcp</URL>
and unpack it using
<Display>\texttt{unzip itcp-x.zip}</Display>
Do this preferably inside the <Math>pkg</Math> subdirectory
of your GAP 4 installation. It creates a subdirectory called <Math>itcp</Math>.
This completes the installation of the package. If you do not know the whereabouts of the <Math>pkg</Math> subdirectory, invoke the following in GAP:
<Listing Type="Code"><![CDATA[
GAPInfo.("RootPaths");
]]></Listing>

Look for pkg directory inside any of the paths returned.
One can then start using ITCP by invoking
<Display>gap></Display>
<Listing Type="Code"><![CDATA[
LoadPackage( "itcp");
]]></Listing>

from within GAP. This would automatically load the dependencies <Math>symchm</Math> and <Math>\texttt{qsopt}\_\texttt{ex-interface}</Math>, so you don't have to load them seperately.
