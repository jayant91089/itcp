  [33X[0;0YITCP  requires GAP package symchm [Apt16] for symmetry exploiting polyhedral
  projection,  along  with  package  [23X\texttt{qsopt}\_\texttt{ex-interface}[123X for
  solving  linear  programs  exactly  using  rational arithmetic. You can find
  information  about  how to install them in their respective user manuals. To
  get   the   newest   version   of  ITCP,  download  the  .zip  archive  from
  [7Xhttps://github.com/jayant91089/itcp[107X and unpack it using[133X

  [33X[0;0YDo  this  preferably inside the [23Xpkg[123X subdirectory of your GAP 4 installation.
  It  creates  a  subdirectory called [23Xitcp[123X. This completes the installation of
  the  package.  If  you  do not know the whereabouts of the [23Xpkg[123X subdirectory,
  invoke the following in GAP:[133X
